#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3
-->
- [x] Create a sample map for the game
- [x] Create draft of instructions for R.E.M. Invasion
- [x] Finish physical prototype.
- [ ] Choose engine to create digital prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - *Summarize completed tasks or progress made.*
  -  Finished the sample map layout to do test runs.
  -  Designed tiles for the boards and ideas for traits
- **Challenges faced**:
  - *Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.*
  -  Issue with players not being able to interact frequently, especially in a 1v1 situation.
  -  Issues with size of map and speed of travel players will find themselves with.
- **Solutions**:
  - *Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.*
  - Simply double the dice for regular movement (2 D6).
  - Allow players to receive a random item at the beginning of the game.

#### Learnings
- *Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.*
- A lot of the things which slow the game down are things which could be automated by the computer.
- Key insight: I hate board games.
- The theme of the game being so surreal means that it can feel unfocused and unintuitive. There needs to be more than just dreams to allow players to better understand certain rules of the game.


#### Free Thinking
- *Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.*
-  Aggro-based system for chaser.
  - Feedback suggests that aggro should be random, based on a dice roll. However, this would require players to be able to move back and forth or escape.
  - The chaser should run in the same direction as another player.

 
- Map-Based changes
  - Allow players to connect different halves of the board.
  - Adds in multiple arrangements for map effects.

#### Next Steps
- *Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.*
- Find an engine to create digital prototype.
- Playtest more to create figure out a fun balance.
