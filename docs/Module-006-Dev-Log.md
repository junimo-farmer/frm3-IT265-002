#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3
-->
- [ ] Create a sample map for the game
- [x] Go to Dollar Store to pick out materials
- [x] Work on First Draft of Treatment

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - *Summarize completed tasks or progress made.*
  -  Created a better map using four separate areas:
    - Star Ocean
    - Victorian Mansions
    - Field of Cosmos
    - Abandoned Factory
- **Challenges faced**:
  - *Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.*
  - Could not figure out what sanity level would be a good balance for players to play with (resource management)
  - Chaser is too boring. Chases but does nothing else. Needs some other interactions with players.
  - 
- **Solutions**:
  - *Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.*
  -  Feedback and mapping costs for sanity has led me to believe that my previous choice of 5 is too small. Increase to 7.
  -  

#### Learnings
- *Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.*
- Interaction is king.


#### Free Thinking
- *Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.*
-  Aggro-based system
  - Have a single chaser start from the center of the map.
  - Use aggro mechanics which allow the chaser to target.

  - Insanity buffs/debuffs card
    - *imparnumerophobia* - all odd rolls are 0
    - *devil's loyal customer* - can shop for free
    - *screecher* - players around you lose sanity
    - *hallucinogenic* - rolls twice, choose one
   
- Map-Based changes
  - Unique effects based on tiles landed.
  - Can use one big map and separate into four quadrants, or allow players to change the field into certain themes, where tiles will gain different effects. 

#### Next Steps
- *Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.*
- rethink design of mechanics based on feedback.
- Add more interactions between mechanics.
