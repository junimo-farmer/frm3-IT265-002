  -  No solutions so far.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
-  Currently still not in the development stage, but it was interesting to think about emergence and how fun that kind of thing is in a game. I would like to develop a game that has this sort of principle. This helped me brainstorm the philsoophy for DBDW studios.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
  <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->
- N/A, but will consider examples of emergence. (Games such as The Binding of Isaac which are simple in controls, but heavy in mechanics from rules).
#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
