<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3
-->
- [ ] Create a sample map for the game
- [ ] Rethink objectives for the game (something other than reach the end)
- [ ] Rethink mechanics to prevent Mario Party Clone.
- [ ] Learn more about randomness and its effects on games
- [ ] Consider how impactful randomness is in the game.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - *Summarize completed tasks or progress made.*
  -  
- **Challenges faced**:
  - *Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.*
  -  
- **Solutions**:
  - *Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.*
  - 

#### Learnings
- *Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.*
-   


#### Free Thinking
- *Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.*
-  If I cannot avoid making Mario Party, just make Mario Party and tweak it from there.
-  Goal for the game:
  - Collect enough core memories before daytime
  - Avoid nightmares and chasers
- Mechanics to consider
  - Sanity Mechanic
    - Being caught by a chaser is not the end, it simply greatly injures your sanity
    - After losing a majority of your sanity, you become deranged
    - Receive negative and some positive effects which make the game more chaotic
    - Losing too much sanity will mean a bust (trapped)
  - Time Mechanic
    - The game will play for 8 turns (8 hours).
    - Nighttime (1-4 hours)
      - Brain is still deep in sleep, game progresses normally
      - Meant to allow a slower pace start
    - Daytime (5-8 hours)
      - Brain is in deep sleep and REM begins
      - Chasers become more chaotic
  - Dream Powerups (hold two at most)
    - can create traps, improve chances, help with chasers, or increase speed
      - Tissue effect, Dice Effect, Invisibility Effect, Bike Effect
  - 

#### Next Steps
- *Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.*
