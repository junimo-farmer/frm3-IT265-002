#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3
-->
- [ ] Create a sample map for the game
- [ ] Rethink objectives for the game (something other than reach the end)
- [x] Learn more about color theory and their effects on games (choosing a color palette is difficult)
- [ ] Rethink mechanics to prevent Mario Party Clone.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - *Summarize completed tasks or progress made.*
  -  Created some version of sample map, albeit rudimentary and lacking in thought
- **Challenges faced**:
  - *Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.*
  -  Color Theory is so annoying and difficult to think about, that it may be better just to choose something that doesn't look childish.
  -  Board design is difficult to balance (either too unbalanced or boring). Considering tossing the thing altogether.
  -  Mario Party clone :(
- **Solutions**:
  - *Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.*
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- *Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.*
-  Color Theory
  - Can have subtle but significant effects on game mood and feel
  - A quick way to instruct players indirectly.
  - Can be used to subvert messages
  - Can have indirect consequences to your game if you are not careful


#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  N/A, currently need to consider what would be a fun board game. Want to ask a friend.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Collaborate, because my mind is cooked.
