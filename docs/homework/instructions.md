## R.E.M. Invasion - Official Rulebook
---
### Game Overview
---
R.E.M. Invasion is a surrealist adventure board game where 2 or 4 players compete to be the first to collect a dream artifact around the map to open the gate back to the real world. After being trapped in the **Dream World**, your goal is to explore the different areas and bring these artifacts to **The Door** to allow escape from the world. Players use effects, dice, and the map features to deliver these artifacts without losing their sanity and being trapped in the **Dream World** forever. Only one player can escape, so do your best to be the one to keep your mind!

### Objectives and Win Conditions!
---
Collect one of several **Dream Artifacts** to open **The Door**.


Artifacts will be granted if:
- Blood - Kills another player.
- Greed - Purchases at every zone
- Clarity - Do not become deranged or insane for 12 rounds

**The Door** will accept **one** artifact and lock forever. Everyone else will be trapped.
Of course, if everyone goes insane, the game ends there too.


### Game Setup
---
- Board
  - Put together two halves of the board and places players in at the center door (purple box).
- Effect, Traits, and Item Cards
  - Shuffle them and place them in an appropriate stack.
- Give each player 6 sanity points
- The order players will move in a turn is decided by dice roll (highest wins)
  - In event of tie, reroll.

### Game Cycle
---

Game will continue until a player escapes, or all players are insane.

### Phases of a Turn
---
During their turns players can choose to either:
1. Use an item
2. Move with a dice roll.

They cannot use an item after moving, and must use them beforehand. After landing on a trait space, they can reorganize or discard them. If they use an item, they can still choose to roll to move afterwards.

### Movement and Tiles

Tiles around the map have different effects for those who land on them.
