## R.E.M. Invasion - Official Rulebook
---
### Game Overview
---
R.E.M. Invasion is a surrealist adventure board game where players cooperate to collect dream artifacts around the map to open the gate back to the real world. After being trapped in the **Dream World**, your goal is to explore the different areas and bring these artifacts to **The Door** to allow escape from the world. Players use effects, dice, and the map features to deliver these artifacts without losing their sanity and being trapped in the **Dream World** forever...

### Objective
---
Collect **Dream Artifacts** to open **The Door**.
Escape within the allotted amount of rounds (usually 24).

Artifacts will be granted if:
Blood - Kills another player.
Greed - Purchases at every zone
Clarity - Do not become deranged or insane for 12 rounds


### Game Setup
---
- Board
  - Put together two halves of the board and places players in at the center door (purple box).
- Effect Cards
  - Shuffle them
- Give each player 6 sanity points (cotton)
- The order players will move in a turn is decided by dice roll (highest wins)
  - In event of tie, reroll.

### Game Cycle
---
The game will last for **24 turns**.

*Night Time* (Turns 1-12)
- No new effects on map
*Day Time* (Turns 13-24)
- At the beginning of day time, every player receives one positive trait and one negative trait.
### Phases of a Turn
---
During their turns players can choose to either:
1. Use an item
2. Move with a dice roll.

They cannot use an item after moving, and must use them beforehand. After landing on a trait space, they can reorganize or discard them.

### Traits & Effects & Items
---
Players can hold up to 6 Traits (3 positive and 3 negative). They can also hold up to two Items.

 - Traits
   - Passive Effects which can benefit or harm the player for a set amount of turns. These can be received via the colored circles (green for good, and red for negative).
     - A player who holds more than 3 traits of any kind will be forced to remove the earliest of its kind.
     - Examples:
       - Positive
         - Pretty Flower: +1 to sanity when you roll a 3.
         - Mom's High Heels: +1 to dice roll
         - Seeing Double: 50% chance to not consume an item when used.
       - Negative
