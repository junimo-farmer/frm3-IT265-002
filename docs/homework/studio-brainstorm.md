# Game Studio Brainstorming Assignment

- **Alternative Ideas:**
  - [Foxhole Studio]
  - [Nailbiter]
  - [Sunset Woods Studio]

- **Chosen Name**: DBDW Studios
- **About the name**: The phrase "do bad, die worse" can be interpreted in two ways. To do bad and die worse could mean to go all out and commit to a choice, which is an important attitude to have for a game studio. Everything produced must be to 100%. Another way to interpret this is to promise that if our games are bad, we will suffer a worse fate.

## Vision Statement
*What is the mission of your solo game studio? How does it align with creating and analyzing innovative game architectures?*

> [To create and achieve more than before; if we do bad we die worse.]
> We want to design our products with the best we have currently and to evolve as we grow. What we design should be down with that same sentiment of the phrase "do bad, die worse". Everything is taken up to a notch with failure not being an option. This style of design should create fun games with gameplay mechanics taken to an extreme.
