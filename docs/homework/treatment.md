## Core Gameplay Mechanics
- **Primary Mechanics**: *List the main actions players will perform*.
  - Sanity Mechanic
    - Characters keep a total of 6 sanity points to begin with
    - Being caught by a chaser is not the end, it simply greatly injures your sanity
    - After losing a majority of your sanity points, (on 2 sanity points) you become **deranged**
  - Deranged
    - Receive negative and some positive effects which make the game more chaotic
      - i.e *imparnumerophobia* - all odd rolls are reduced to 0.
      - i.e *deal with the devil* - can purchase at shops for free.
    - Can be helpful in some ways, but negative to other players and yourself

## Story and Setting
- **Setting**: *Describe the world and its rules.*
  - The board explores the mind of **The Dreamer**, an entity between reality and fiction whose R.E.M. induced hallucinations serve as the foundation for the Dream World that you players will be trying to escape. Between lavender-filled clouds, dark Victorian mansions, a field of cosmsos, an ocean of stars, and many other worlds, you must find artifacts which allow you to open **The Door** to escape the Dream World. Avoid the nightmares that spawn from **The Dreamer**'s mind, which seek to keep you inside.
  - The theme of the game is of one of collaboration to escape the **Dream World**. There are several themed-areas as described in the setting. The mood of the game should be one of tension, planning, and silly effects. 
- **Plot**: Outline the main narrative arc.
  -   After falling asleep, you dreamers are caught within the space between reality and fiction. Trapped, you must collect fragments scattered throughout the map to escape through **The Door** before the sun rises. Failing to open **The Door** will cause you to be trappped within the space for good, with no hope for escape. You will need to explore through a world of different styles of dreams, being chased by nightmares, while trying to remain sane enough to see the exit.
- **Characters**: *Key figures, their roles, and how they drive the story.*
  - There are 1-4 players in the game that can choose several types of avatars to represent themselves. Their icons represent their favorite desserts (because that's what I could find at DAISO).
     - Chocolate Biscuit: 
     - Pink Macaron:
     - Strawberry Creme Donut:
     - Chocolate Frosting Donut:

  - Character choice has no affect on the game.

- Chasers:
  - Shadow Lady: a woman in black dressed in victorian clothes with red eyes. They will chase a player through the map based on aggro.

## Unique Selling Points (USP)
- Highlight what makes this game stand out compared to others in the genre.
  - Chaser mechanic and possible expansions to dream map
  - Ability to compete or collaborate based on player choices

Not many games are targeting the dreamspace and I think R.E.M. is a good way to play with friends who enjoy surrealism.   

- Target Audience: Those who stay inside and want a fun way to spend an hour. Those who enjoy surrealist or niche board games.
- Demographics: Young Adults - Teenagers
  - The game theme is that of dreams and surrealist settings. Certain aspects of the setting are given meaning, but others are left to the imagination of the players. Young Adults and Teens who like to stay indoors may find that this game provides a way to create their own experience while adding some tension to their boring lives.

## Inspiration
- **Sources**: Reference books, movies, historical events, or games.
  - *Yume Nikki*: a 2004 adventure game created by the pseudonymous Japanese developer Kikiyama. The player controls a girl named Madotsuki and explores her dreams, collecting 24 effects that change her appearance and equipment.
- **Why it Matters**: How does this inspiration inform the gameâ€™s design?
  - *Yume Nikki*: The evnironment and feeling of playing this niche game is something that I wanted to capture for the gameboard. I think certain parts of this game, such as the tilemaps and sound design are unique, and it manages to create an ecosystem that is beloved by certain fans. This game creates the foundation for the idea behind the setting, surrealist nature, and chasers.
